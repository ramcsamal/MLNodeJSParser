## Business Rules

1. All customers must provide valid identification before opening an account. The identification must be government-issued and must not be expired.

2. If the transaction amount exceeds $10,000, additional verification is required. This includes verifying the source of funds and obtaining manager approval.

3. Customers who maintain a minimum balance of $5,000 shall receive priority customer service and waived monthly fees.

## Formulas and Calculations

Total Cost = Base Price + (Base Price × Tax Rate) + Shipping Fee

Monthly Interest = Principal × (Annual Rate / 12)

Discount Amount = Original Price × Discount Percentage

If Quantity > 100 then Unit Price = Base Price × 0.9

## Conditions

When a customer's account balance falls below $100, a notification must be sent within 24 hours.

Unless otherwise specified in writing, all refunds must be processed within 14 business days.

In case of payment default, late fees will be assessed at 1.5% per month.

Provided that the customer has maintained good standing for 12 months, credit limit increases may be granted.
